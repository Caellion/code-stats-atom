* Fixed crash when doing "Replace all" (editor was not available)
* `apm` wanted to bump the version to 1.3.x for some reason

## 1.2.2 - Another XP fix

* Copypasting and find-replace operations also resulted in huge amounts of XP in some situations. XP was now limited to a max of 200 per operation.

## 1.2.1 - Fix for too much XP

* Fixed an issue where operating on a big file gave ridiculous amounts of XP.

## 1.2.0 - Published in Atom repos

## 1.0.0 - First public release
* Added correct licence
* Some doc fixes

## 0.1.4 - Less load

* Added correct default address

## 0.1.0 - Initial alpha release
* Works quite fine
